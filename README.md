# Plantbaby

Plant parenthood is increasingly becoming popular for a variety of resaons- the remote working era instigated by covid, any other kind of parenthood becoming unattainable due to cost, the popularity of plants as a hobby and aesthetic, etc. Many lack the skill to keep plants alive and elect to keep fake plants instead. Plantbaby is an AR solution to this issue, it will allow any new Plant parent to identify what plants they own and exactly how to take care of them. 

## Goal

Plantbaby should be able to identify the type of plants and its needs, as well as diagnose any pertaining issues that plant might have. Helping young adults take care of houseplants will ideally make the idea of "plant parenthood" more achievable. 

## Interviews

It was important to interview two types of potential users in order to identify their needs and what they would want from such an app. One user demographic would be current plant owners who are looking for assistance in keeping track of their many plants, another user demographic would be prospective plant owners who are interested in foraying into plant parenthood but have no existing knowledge. 

### Interview questions

* How many plants do you currently have, if any?
* Can you share the struggles you face taking care of those plants?
* If not, what has stopped you from buying a plant?
* What would make you buy a plant?
* What would make it easier on you to take care of plants?
* Would you consider an app that advised you on “plant parenthood”

### Pain Points

#### CURRENT PLANT PARENTS
* Too many plants to keep track of (one interviewee had an estimated 40+ plants/cuttings)
* Trouble taking care of difficult plants (ie. orchids)
* Plants they own seem to exhibit several unidentified issues 
* Need advice from others

#### PROSPECTIVE PLANT PARENTS
* Not knowing enough about plants to think about buying one
* Not knowing what plants are what at the store
* Looking up plant related forums  too overwhelming
* What materials they need
